---

### **1. 📝 Written Test**

* Around 11–12 questions shared among all candidates.
* Domains covered: 11th & 12th standard Physics, Mathematics, and Basic Electronics.
* Topics included:

  * ⚛️ **Physics:** Kinematics, Electrostatics, Newton’s Laws, Gravitational Force
  * ➗ **Math:** Geometric Progression (sum), Basic Differentiation and Integration
  * 🔌 **Electronics:** Operational Amplifiers, Comparators, Inverters, Digital Circuits
  * ⚙️ **Motors:** Back EMF, Efficiency calculations
* All relevant formulas were provided upfront.
* **Key Assessment:** Application of core science/engineering knowledge from schooling and early college.

---

### **2. 💻 Round 1 - C Programming**

* Platform: [Examly](https://examly188.examly.io)
* Duration: 1 hour
* 3 Programming Questions
* **Constraint:** Must attempt questions in sequential order; skipping not allowed.

**Sample Questions:**

* 🖱️ **Scroll Bar Simulation:** Given 0/1 input to denote if two sliders are locked, modify the sliders accordingly based on input updates.
* 🔢 **Odd-Even Array Sort:** Given an array, sort odd and even elements separately. If the smallest number is even, place evens in front in ascending order and odds at the back in descending order. Reverse this if smallest is odd.

---

### **3. 👥 HR Interview**

* Friendly and casual.
* Questions focused on communication style, motivation, character assessment.
* Discussion on hobbies, interests, long-term goals, and company fit.

### **4. 🧠 Technical Interview**

* Resume-driven.
* Questions based on projects listed.
* Key focus on core electronics, C fundamentals, microcontrollers, VLSI basics.
* Debugging or scenario-based hardware/software questions.

**Note:** Evaluators had access to prior round performances including C code and test scores.

The next round was HR and technical interviews. This was the same as the regular one. All questions were from the projects and resume content that I had put. The technical questions were focused on basic details and fundamental applications. While the HR round was just a formal talk, the HR was able to analyse my character from the questions she asked. And Soliton believes in analyzing you as a whole. As you move on to the next round, all your previous round results including programming rounds are all printed and documented and used in the final stages.
